I would like to measure how these data structures perform at lower values of n.
With the values we used starting at 5000, trees did not ever perform better than
hash tables and I have a feeling that if we tried lower values of n we might have
seen trees do better. Overall I think that testing with lower values of n is
necessary to see how trees and hash tables compare on the full spectrum of their
performance.
